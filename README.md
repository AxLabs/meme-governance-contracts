# Contracts for a Governance Protocol

The contracts in this repository are built for a decentralized application (dApp) together with a [frontend](https://github.com/AxLabs/meme-governance-frontend).

This project should demonstrate how a decentralized application (dApp) could be built on the Neo blockchain, using Java and React/NextJS.

The contracts implement a governance protocol, where users can:

- Create a proposal to add a new meme.
- Create a proposal to remove an existing meme.
- Vote on an existing proposal (either to add or remove) within a specified timeframe.
- Execute a proposal that was accepted in the vote.
- Get the currently persisted memes.

There is a detailed documentation, that you can read [here](https://neow3j.io/#/neo-n3/tutorials_and_examples/meme_governance_dapp).
